# dashing.rs

`dashing` is a library for building console-style roguelike games in Rust.

**This is not an official Google product.**

## Current status

This project is currently in a pre-alpha state. It currently provides a rudimentary truecolor
character console, with basic input handling capabilities, but it needs a *lot* more thought put
into the API before it is ready for prime time.

## Getting Started

See the rustdoc for an example of the engine in use.
