# dashing.rs

`dashing` is a library for building console-style roguelike games in Rust.

**This is not an official Google product.**

## Current status

This project is currently in a pre-alpha state. It currently provides a rudimentary truecolor
character console, with basic input handling capabilities, but it needs a *lot* more thought put
into the API before it is ready for prime time.

It also currently only compiles on nightly Rust, due to the use of some 2018 Edition features. This
should hopefully change after 2018 is stable.

## Getting Started

See the rustdoc for an example of the engine in use.
